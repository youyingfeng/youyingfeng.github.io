        <p>My name is You Yingfeng. I'm an undergraduate in NUS, currently studying computer science.
        I do landscape and event photography, but I'm also looking to branch out into other genres.
        I am inspired by many photographers and artists, like Yoshitaka Amano, Lukasz Palka, and Yuumei, among others.</p>

        <p>This website is obviously unfinished, and it is unlikely that any serious person would stumble upon this site.
        Many pictures are placeholders; for example, the picture on the right is a placeholder for a portrait of myself,
        but since I don't do portraits, a picture of the Tokyo Skytree will have to do. And yes, that is my picture.</p>

        <p>Also, I use a barcode as my logo because I'm too arsed to design a proper one. I'm also not skilled enough to
        design one of my own, but that is beside the point. I took most of my design inspiration from Lukasz Palka's portfolio,
        but the code is entirely mine. Tbh its a pretty standard web portfolio anyway kappa.</p>

        <p>apparently the logo is broken on firefox 68, because it cant load the fonts locally. thanks mozilla. now i have to load
        everything via google api.</p>

        <p>this shit is fucking lightweight, everything is accomplished using css, no jabbascript.</p>
