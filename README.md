I wrote this shit from scratch so forgive me for any bugs.
Based on the motherfuckingwebsites aesthetic and inspired by Lukasz Palka's portfolio design, but the code is all mine.

should really implement jabbascript soon for mobile compatibility, but only if i do modal lightbox.
also should implement a flexbox gallery
